# Puro REST Framework

> In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is
no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take
away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.

-- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry --

## Introduction

*Puro* is an API-driven REST Framework for building robust and scalable
Web APIs.

The framework is built on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and
[TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm). It follows the *Model-View-Controller*
pattern, where the *View* has been replaced by a simpler *Schema* (*MSC*?).

Finally, to make things dead simple, it speaks only two languages: *HTTP* and *JSON*.

## Principles

- Don't repeat yourself!
- Don't write what you don't have to!
- Do one thing and do it well!

## Features

- Plugin-oriented architecture;
- Comfortable Object-Oriented design, thanks to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/);
- Automatic request validation;
- Automatic ORM entity resolution (*WIP*);
- Automatic response serialization (*WIP*);
- Built-in service container (*WIP*);
- Built-in logging (*WIP*);
- High-quality code and full test coverage;
